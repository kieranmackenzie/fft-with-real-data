# fft-with-real-data
fast fourier transform implemented with real data. Finding the total harmonic distortion and fundamental frequency.  Needs a reactive bin size when checking for harmonics in order for it to be a more complete code, or using the frequency analysis package from MATLAB to find these harmonics.
